## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r assignment1 echo=TRUE}

##Reading the data file
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',')
##loading packages required
library(lubridate)
library(plyr)
##Changing the format of date from factor to date 
data$date<-ymd(as.character(data$date))
##Data preparation for computing total no. of steps taken per day
activity_date <- group_by(data, date)
activity_summarise <- summarize(activity_date,steps=sum(steps))
##filtering out  Nas
activity_summary<-activity_summarise %>%filter(!is.na(steps))
##plotting histogram the total number of steps taken each day
hist(activity_summary$steps,xlab="Steps taken per day",main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken per day")
##Computing and printing mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean_steps <- mean(activity_summary$steps)
median_steps <- median(activity_summary$steps)
mean_steps
median_steps
## Data preparation for average daily activity pattern
activity_interval <- group_by(data, interval)%>%filter(!is.na(steps))
activity_mean_steps<-summarize(activity_interval,steps=mean(steps))

##Finding and printing the interval with maximum mean no. of steps
interval_maxm <- activity_mean_steps[which.max(activity_mean_steps$steps),]
interval_maxm

## Calculating total no. of Nas in dataset
total_no_na<-sum(is.na(data$steps))
total_no_na
##Replacing missing values i.e imputing Nas in steps by taking mean for that interval
nas <- is.na(data$steps)
mean_interval <- tapply(data$steps, data$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)
data$steps[nas] <- mean_interval[as.character(data$interval[nas])]

##Calculating mean and median total number of steps taken per day with imputed Nas
mean_steps_imp <- mean(activity_steps_impna$steps)
median_steps_imp <- median(activity_steps_impna$steps)
mean_steps_imp
median_steps_imp

##Creating a new variable day_type

data<-mutate(data,day_type=ifelse(weekdays(data$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(data$date) == "Sunday", "Weekend", "Weekday"))
data$day_type <- as.factor(data$day_type)

##Data preparation for panel plot
data_steps_interval_daytype <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day_type, data =data, FUN = mean)






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=TRUE}
##plotting time series plot of interval and  average number of steps taken across all days
hist(activity_steps_impna$steps,xlab="No.of steps taken per day ",main="Histogram of total no. of steps taken per day with imputed NAs")

##plotting the histogram of No. of steps per day with imputed Na values of steps
activity_steps_impna <- data%>%group_by(date) %>%  summarize(steps = sum(steps))
hist(activity_steps_impna$steps,xlab="No.of steps taken per day ",main="Histogram of total no. of steps taken per day with imputed NAs")
# Time series plot between interval and average no. of steps for weekend and weekday
xyplot(steps~interval|day_type,data=data_steps_interval_daytype,type="l",lwd=1,xlab="Interval",ylab="Avg.no. of steps",layout=c(1,2))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
